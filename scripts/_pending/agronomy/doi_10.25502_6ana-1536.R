## ISSUES
# NOTE: this was moved to pending due to missing information
# in 2021-11-24t035520phenotype_download.csv "harvestDate" is an empty column
# in 2021-11-24t035520phenotype_download.csv "locationName" lists Ibadan as the location but "studyDescription" and the datasets title place trial in Lanlate
# the dataset is described as a "Fertilizer experiment" in both the description and title but NO fertiliser information is given, so all fertiliser vars are set to NA and treatment_var in metadata is left empty
# variables dry_matter_content, dry_yield, fresh_yield, fwy_leaves, harvest_index, top_yield all caused issues processing due to discrepancies in column names in csv files downloaded and files loaded by carobiner E.g. "top yield|CO_334:0000017" was only accepted by the script as "top.yield.CO_334.0000017"
# longitude and latitude derived from experiment title. NOTE: it was given on IITA webpage for this dataset, but the coordinates pointed to a Mosque [Aribi-Desi Mosque]
# subject in metadata.csv is listed as Maize when trial was done on cassava.
# "dmy_total" is presented as "dmy_totat" in draft
# "fertilizer_type" is presented as "fertlizer_type" in draft

# 3 seperate yields were recorded in this dataset, so 3 seperate variable names were used instead of the terminags 'yield'"
